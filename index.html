        <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Divyansh" class="profile-pic">
        <p>Hello! I'm Divyansh Nigam,a student at Manipal University Jaipur pursuing BTech in CSE(Data Science and Engineering)
            ,Id say I am a passionate web developer skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I enjoy building interactive and responsive websites.
            I am a passionate and dedicated frontend developer with a growing interest in full-stack and mobile app development. I specialize in building clean, interactive, and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on delivering smooth user experiences and visually appealing designs.

            My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity about how things work on the web, which soon turned into a drive to build my own projects and continuously learn new technologies. I have successfully developed several small-scale projects that demonstrate my creativity, problem-solving mindset, and understanding of user-centric design.
            
            Currently, I am expanding my skill set into App Development with Kotlin and exploring Next.js to create high-performance, scalable web applications. I also enjoy working with Data Structures and Algorithms, which helps me write optimized and efficient code.
            
            I aspire to contribute to meaningful projects that combine design, logic, and innovation ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs crafting dynamic web applications or developing user-friendly mobile apps. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded software developer capable of building solutions that make a positive impact.
